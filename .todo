As a user I have to:
[ ] Save and compare class, enum and fundamental types
[ ] Access and modify members of given class
[ ] Access and call methods of given class
[ ] Access and enumerate on enum values
[ ] Get type by name
[ ] Link rtti library dynamically because I want to have a type defined in one dynamic library to be 
    accessible from another
[ ] Check if given type is an instantiation of given template
[ ] Check if a variable is const or volatile

As a user I'd like to
[ ] Instantiate a template with provided type
